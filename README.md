# MPI-Estimation-Using-Geospatial-Data
MPI: Multidimensional Poverty Index. In this project, I worked on ArcGIS (Geographic Information System) software to analyze geospatial data and export the results from the GIS software into a programming environment for further analysis including visualizations and building models for feature selection and predictions among others. In this review, I have explored different machine learning models for regression like backward-stepwise, ridge regression and elastic nets. Therefore, after obtaining the results, I used those results from data analysis and reconstruct maps in GIS software and make comparisons with the original data I had. I have used night light data for Rwanda to make analysis and predictions.
